## Helpers and serializers

Boost provides many functions for common scenarios and patterns, like
[`isObject`](/api/common/function/isObject) for verifying a value is an object, or
[`toArray`](/api/common/function/toArray) for converting a value to an array.
[View the API for a full list of functions with examples](/api/common#Functions).

#### JSON

Powered by the [JSON5](https://www.npmjs.com/package/json5) package, the
[`json`](/api/common/namespace/json) serializer can be used to parse and stringify JSON data.

```ts
import { json } from '@boost/common';

json.parse(data);
json.stringify(data);
```

#### YAML

Powered by the [YAML](https://www.npmjs.com/package/yaml) package, the
[`yaml`](/api/common/namespace/yaml) serializer can be used to parse and stringify YAML data.

```ts
import { yaml } from '@boost/common';

yaml.parse(data);
yaml.stringify(data);
```

## Class contracts

A [`Contract`][contract]is an abstract class that implements the
[`Optionable`](/api/common/interface/Optionable) interface, which provides an options object layer,
and is meant to be inherited from as a super class. All classes that extend [`Contract`][contract]
accept an options object through the constructor, which is validated and built using
[optimal](https://github.com/milesj/optimal).

To start, extend [`Contract`][contract] with a generic interface that represents the shape of the
options object. Next, implement the abstract
[`Contract#blueprint()`](/api/common/class/Contract#blueprint) method, which is passed
[optimal schemas](https://github.com/milesj/optimal/blob/master/docs/schemas.md) as an argument, and
must return an
[optimal blueprint](https://github.com/milesj/optimal/blob/master/docs/usage.md#blueprint) that
matches the generic interface.

```ts
import { Contract, Blueprint, Schemas } from '@boost/common';

export interface AdapterOptions {
	name?: string;
	priority?: number;
}

export default class Adapter extends Contract<AdapterOptions> {
	blueprint({ number, string }: Schemas): Blueprint<AdapterOptions> {
		return {
			name: string().notEmpty(),
			priority: number().gte(0),
		};
	}
}
```

When the class is instantiated, the provided values will be checked and validated using the
blueprint. If invalid, an error will be thrown. Furthermore, the
[`Contract#options`](/api/common/class/Contract#options) property is `readonly`, and will error when
mutated.

```ts
const adapter = new Adapter({
	name: 'Boost',
});

const { name } = adapter.options; // => Boost
```

### Required options

By default, the options argument in the constructor is optional, and if your interface has a
required property, it will not be bubbled up in TypeScript. To support this, the constructor will
need to be overridden so that the argument can be marked as non-optional.

```ts
export interface AdapterOptions {
	name: string;
	priority?: number;
}

export default class Adapter extends Contract<AdapterOptions> {
	constructor(options: AdapterOptions) {
		super(options);
	}

	// ...
}
```

## Project management

The [`Project`][project] class provides workspace and package metadata for a project. A project is
denoted by a root `package.json` file and abides the npm and Node.js module pattern. To begin,
import and instantiate the [`Project`][project] class with a path to the project's root.

```ts
import { Project } from '@boost/common';

const project = new Project();
```

> Root defaults to `process.cwd()` if not provided.

### Workspaces

The primary feature of this class is to extract metadata about a project's workspaces. Workspaces
are used to support multi-package architectures known as monorepos, typically through
[Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/features/workspaces), [PNPM](https://pnpm.js.org/en/pnpm-workspace_yaml),
or [Lerna](https://github.com/lerna/lerna#lernajson). In Boost, our implementation of workspaces
aligns with:

- **Project** - Typically a repository with a root `package.json`. Can either be a collection of
  packages, or a package itself.
- **Package** - A folder with a `package.json` file that represents an npm package. Contains source
  and test files specific to the package.
- **Workspace** - A folder that houses one or many packages.

### Package graph

The [`PackageGraph`][packagegraph] class can be used to generate a dependency graph for a list of
packages, based on their defined `dependencies` and `peerDependencies`. To begin, import and
instantiate the class, which accepts a list of optional `package.json` objects as the 1st argument.

```ts
import { PackageGraph } from '@boost/common';

const graph = new PackageGraph([
	{
		name: '@boost/common',
		version: '1.2.3',
	},
	{
		name: '@boost/cli',
		version: '1.0.0',
		dependencies: {
			'@boost/common': '^1.0.0',
		},
	},
]);
```

Once all packages have been defined, we can resolve our graph into 1 of 3 formats, using the
following methods. [View the API for more information on these methods][packagegraph].

```ts
const batch = graph.resolveBatchList();
const list = graph.resolveList();
const tree = graph.resolveTree();
```

> Will only resolve and return packages that have been defined. Will _not_ return non-defined
> packages found in `dependencies` and `peerDependencies`.

## Path management

The [`Path`][path] class is an immutable abstraction around file/module paths and the Node.js `fs`
and `path` modules. It aims to solve cross platform and operating system related issues in a
straight forward way. To begin, import and instantiate the [`Path`][path] class, with either a
single path, or a list of path parts that will be joined.

```ts
import { Path } from '@boost/common';

const absPath = new Path('/root/some/path');
const relPath = new Path('some/path', '../move/around', 'again');
```

By default, the class operates on the defined path parts as-is. If you would prefer to operate
against real or resolved paths, use the [`Path#realPath()`](/api/common/class/Path#realPath) and
[`Path#resolve()`](/api/common/class/Path#resolve) methods respectively. The current path is
[resolved against](https://nodejs.org/api/path.html#path_path_resolve_paths) the defined current
working directory (`process.cwd()`).

```ts
path.path(); // Possibly inaccurate
path.resolve().path(); // Resolved accurately
```

With that being said, the class supports many convenient methods.
[View the API for a full list](/api/common/class/Path).

### Static factories

The static [`Path.create()`](/api/common/class/Path#create) and
[`Path.resolve()`](/api/common/class/Path#resolve) methods can be used to factory a [`Path`][path]
instance from a string or an existing instance. Especially useful when used in combination with the
[`PortablePath`](/api/common#PortablePath) type.

```ts
Path.create('some/file/path'); // Path
```

### Resolving lookup paths

The [`PathResolver`][pathresolver] class can be used to find a real path amongst a list of possible
lookups. A lookup is either a file system path or a Node.js module. If a path is found, an absolute
resolved [`Path`][path] instance is returned, otherwise an error is thrown.

A perfect scenario for this mechanism would be finding a valid configuration file, which we'll
demonstrate below. Import and instantiate the class to begin.

```ts
import { PathResolver } from '@boost/common';

const resolver = new PathResolver();

// With a custom module resolver (can be async!)
const resolver = new PathResolver(customResolver);
```

To add a file system lookup, use the
[`PathResolver#lookupFilePath()`](/api/common/class/PathResolver#lookupFilePath) method, which
requires a path and an optional current working directory (defaults to `process.cwd()`).

```ts
// Look in current directory
resolver
	.lookupFilePath('tool.config.js')
	.lookupFilePath('tool.config.json')
	.lookupFilePath('tool.config.yaml');

// Look in a folder
resolver.lookupFilePath('configs/tool.js');

// Look in user's home directory
resolver.lookupFilePath('tool.config.js', os.homedir());
```

And to add a Node.js module lookup, use the
[`PathResolver#lookupNodeModule()`](/api/common/class/PathResolver#lookupNodeModule) method, which
accepts a module name or path.

```ts
// Look in module (assuming index export)
resolver.lookupNodeModule('tool-config-module');

// Look in module with sub-path
resolver.lookupNodeModule('tool-config-module/lib/configs/tool.js');
```

Once all the lookup paths have been defined, the
[`PathResolver#resolve()`](/api/common/class/PathResolver#resolve) method will iterate through them
in order until one is found. If a file system path, `fs.existsSync()` will be used to check for
existence, while the [`resolve`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/resolve) npm package will be used for
Node.js modules. If found, a result object will be returned with the resolved [`Path`][path] and
original lookup parts.

```ts
const { originalSource, resolvedPath, type } = await resolver.resolve();
```

If you'd prefer to only have the resolved path returned, the
[`PathResolver#resolvePath()`](/api/common/class/PathResolver#resolvePath) method can be used
instead.

```ts
const resolvedPath = await resolver.resolvePath();
```
