title: 5.0 migration
sidebar_label: '5.0'
---

## All packages

- Requires TypeScript v5 or greater.
- Dropped Node.js v14 support. Now requires v16.20 and above.
- Updated many dependencies to their latest major version.

### Migrated to ECMAScript modules (`.mjs`)

TODO

## @boost/common

- Migrated from `resolve` to `enhanced-resolve` for `PathResolver`. This is to support
  `package.json` exports. We currently support the `import`, `require`, and `node` conditions.

## @boost/cli

- Upgraded to and now requires React v18.
- Upgraded to and now requires Ink v4. Now uses a WASM based Yoga engine.

## @boost/plugin

- Updated the `Loader` to use dynamic `import()` for loading modules, instead of our `requireModule`
  function from `@boost/module`. This is to support both CJS and ESM files.

## @boost/test-utils

- Migrated from Jest to Vitest.
- Removed the `copyFixtureToMock` function.
