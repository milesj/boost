## Environment variables

- `BOOSTJS_LOG_DEFAULT_LEVEL` (`LogLevel`) - The default log level to use when calling the logger
  function stand alone (the usage examples below). Defaults to the lowest level, `log`.
- `BOOSTJS_LOG_MAX_LEVEL` (`LogLevel`) - The maximum level, based on priority, to write to a stream.
  All levels higher than the maximum will be ignored. Defaults to allowing all levels.

## Usage

Logging is based around the concept of a "logger", which provides a set of functions of severity
levels to log with. Logs are written to one or many provided transports -- or `console` if not
defined. To begin, instantiate a logger with `createLogger`, which returns a function that can be
used for standard level logging.

```ts
import { createLogger } from '@boost/log';

const log = createLogger({ name: 'boost' });

log('Something has happened…');
```

Each logging function requires a message string as the 1st argument, and an optional rest of
arguments to interpolate into the message using
[util.format()](https://nodejs.org/api/util.html#util_util_format_format_args).

```ts
log('Name: %s %s', user.first_name, user.last_name);
log('Object: %O', data);
```

If you would prefer to interact with a class instance, you may use the `Logger` class. The major
difference between the class and the function, is that the class only has 1 logging method, `log()`.

```ts
import { Logger } from '@boost/log';

const logger = new Logger({ name: 'boost' });

logger.log({
  level: 'info',
  message: 'Something else has happened…',
});
```

### Options

The following options can be defined when creating a logger. They _cannot_ be customized after the
fact.

- `labels` (`object`) - A mapping of localized log level names. Can be used with
  [chalk](https://www.npmjs.com/package/chalk).
- `name` (`string`) - Unique name of this logger instance, for debugging purposes. _(Required)_
- `transports` (`Transportable[]`) - List of transports in which to write formatted log messages to.

```ts
import chalk from 'chalk';
import { createLogger, StreamTransport } from '@boost/log';

const log = createLogger({
  name: 'boost',
  labels: {
    error: chalk.bgRed.black.bold(' FAIL '),
  },
  transports: [new StreamTransport({ levels: ['error'], stream: process.stderr })],
});
```

### Log levels

There are 5 distinct logging levels outside the standard level, each represented as a unique
function on the logger instance. The levels in order of **priority** are `trace`, `debug`, `info`,
`warn`, and `error`. Each function requires a message as the 1st argument, and an optional rest of
arguments to interpolate into the message.

```ts
log.trace('Code path hit?');
log.debug('What is going on here?');
log.info('Systems are stable');
log.warn('Something is definitely going on…');
log.error('Systems are down! %s', error.message);
```

### Formats

All logs are represented as an object, known as a log item. These items contain the following
metadata about the environment, the logger, and the current log message.

- `host` (`string`) - The host name of the machine.
- `label` (`string`) - The log level as a localized or customized label.
- `level` (`LogLevel`) - The log level as a string.
- `message` (`string`) - The log message with interpolated arguments applied.
- `metadata` (`object`) - [Additional data](#metadata) to include with a log item.
- `name` (`string`) - Name of the logger.
- `pid` (`number`) - Current process ID.
- `time` (`string`) - Timestamp of the log, native to the host machine.

Before an item is written to a transport, it must be formatted from an object into a string. This
can be done on a per transport basis using the `format` option, like so.

```ts
import { ConsoleTransport, formats } from '@boost/log';

const transport = new ConsoleTransport({
  format: (item) => `${item.level} ${item.message}`,
  // Or a pre-built format
  format: formats.json,
});
```

Boost provides formats by default, all of which are pre-configured into each built-in transport.
Feel free to use the following built-in formats, or customize your own!

- `formats.console` - Formats the item as if it's being logged to `console`. Only inclues the label
  and message.
- `formats.debug` - Formats the item into a human-readable message with all item fields included.
  This is the default format for most transports.
- `formats.json` - Formats the entire item into JSON.
- `formats.message` - Formats the item using only the message.

### Metadata

Sometimes additional metadata may be required that is not found within the pre-defined log item
fields. Metadata can be defined on the logger using an object, which is then passed to all log
items.

```ts
const log = createLogger({
  name: 'boost',
  metadata: {
    locale: 'en',
    region: 'eu',
  },
});
```

It can also be defined per log by passing an object as the 1st argument. Metadata defined at this
level will override the logger metadata.

```ts
log({ locale: 'de' }, "What's going on?");
```

> Fields `name`, `host`, and `pid` are reserved names and cannot be used.

### Silencing output

By default, all logged messages are immediately written to the configured transports. To silence
output and disable writes, call the `logger.disable()` function, and to re-enable, call
`logger.enable()`.

```ts
log.disable();

// Will not write!
log.debug('Something is broken!');
```

> Messages that are logged while silenced are _lost_ and are _not_ buffered.

## Transport types

There are multiple types of transports that can be used within a logger, all of which support the
following shared options.

- `eol` (`string`) - End of line character to append to a message. Defaults to `os.EOL`.
- `format` (`Formatter`) - Function to format a log item into a message string. Default is transport
  dependent.
- `levels` (`LogLevel[]`) - List of log levels to only write messages for. _(Required)_

### `ConsoleTransport`

Logs messages to the native `console` and its corresponding level. This is the default transport
when no transports are defined.

```ts
import { ConsoleTransport } from '@boost/log';

const transport = new ConsoleTransport();
```

### `StreamTransport`

Logs messages to any writeable stream or an object that defines a `write(message: string)` method.

```ts
import { StreamTransport } from '@boost/log';

const transport = new StreamTransport({
  levels: ['error', 'warn'],
  stream: process.stderr,
});
```

### `FileTransport`

Appends and logs messages to a file at the defined path. Will automatically rotate files when a max
file size is met.

```ts
import { FileTransport } from '@boost/log';

const transport = new FileTransport({
  levels: ['error'],
  path: '/var/log/error.log',
});
```

- `gzip` (`boolean`) - Apply gzip compression to the write stream.
- `maxSize` (`number`) - Maximum file size before rotating file. Will create a backup and truncate
  the current file. Defaults to 10mb.
- `path` (`string | Path`) - Absolute file system path for the intended log file. _(Required)_

### `RotatingFileTransport`

Like `FileTransport`, but also rotates files based on timestamps and a chosen periodic interval.

```ts
import { RotatingFileTransport } from '@boost/log';

const transport = new RotatingFileTransport({
  levels: ['error'],
  path: '/var/log/error.log',
  rotation: 'daily',
});
```

- `rotation` (`hourly | daily | weekly | monthly`) - Period in which to rotate files. Will append a
  timestamp to the rotated log file.

## Test utilities

The following [Jest](https://github.com/facebook/jest) utilities are available in the
`@boost/log/lib/testing` module.

### `mockLogger`

> mockLogger(): Logger

Returns a Jest spy that matches the return value shape of `createLogger`.

```ts
import { mockLogger } from '@boost/log/lib/testing';

it('calls the logger', () => {
  const log = mockLogger();

  log('Something has happened');

  expect(log).toHaveBeenCalled();
});
```
