## Environment variables

- `BOOSTJS_LOG_DEFAULT_LEVEL` ([`LogLevel`](/api/log#LogLevel)) - The default log level to use when
  calling the logger function stand alone (the usage examples below). Defaults to the lowest level,
  `log`.
- `BOOSTJS_LOG_MAX_LEVEL` ([`LogLevel`](/api/log#LogLevel)) - The maximum level, based on priority,
  to write to a stream. All levels higher than the maximum will be ignored. Defaults to allowing all
  levels.

## Logging

Logging is based around the concept of a "logger", which provides a set of functions of severity
levels to log with. Logs are written to one or many provided transports -- or `console` if not
defined. To begin, instantiate a logger with [`createLogger`](/api/log/function/createLogger), which
returns a function that can be used for standard level logging.

```ts
import { createLogger } from '@boost/log';

const log = createLogger({ name: 'boost' });

log('Something has happened…');
```

Each logging function requires a message string as the 1st argument, and an optional rest of
arguments to interpolate into the message using
[`util.format()`](https://nodejs.org/api/util.html#util_util_format_format_args).

```ts
log('Name: %s %s', user.first_name, user.last_name);
log('Object: %O', data);
```

If you would prefer to interact with a class instance, you may use the
[`Logger`](/api/log/class/Logger) class. The major difference between the class and the function, is
that the class only has 1 logging method, [`Logger#log()`](/api/log/class/Logger#log).

```ts
import { Logger } from '@boost/log';

const logger = new Logger({ name: 'boost' });

logger.log({
  level: 'info',
  message: 'Something else has happened…',
});
```

### Options

When creating a logger, a [`LoggerOptions`](/api/log/interface/LoggerOptions) object can be passed.
The options _cannot_ be customized after the fact.

```ts
import chalk from 'chalk';
import { createLogger, StreamTransport } from '@boost/log';

const log = createLogger({
  name: 'boost',
  labels: {
    error: chalk.bgRed.black.bold(' FAIL '),
  },
  transports: [new StreamTransport({ levels: ['error'], stream: process.stderr })],
});
```

### Log levels

There are 5 distinct logging levels outside the standard level, each represented as a unique
function on the logger instance. The levels in order of **priority** are `trace`, `debug`, `info`,
`warn`, and `error`. Each function requires a message as the 1st argument, and an optional rest of
arguments to interpolate into the message.

```ts
log.trace('Code path hit?');
log.debug('What is going on here?');
log.info('Systems are stable');
log.warn('Something is definitely going on…');
log.error('Systems are down! %s', error.message);
```

### Silencing output

By default, all logged messages are immediately written to the configured transports. To silence
output and disable writes, call the [`logger.disable()`](/api/log/interface/LoggerFunction#disable)
function, and to re-enable, call [`logger.enable()`](/api/log/interface/LoggerFunction#enable).

```ts
log.disable();

// Will not write!
log.debug('Something is broken!');
```

> Messages that are logged while silenced are _lost_ and are _not_ buffered.

## Formats

All logs are represented as an object, known as a [`LogItem`](/api/log/interface/LogItem). These
items contain metadata about the environment, the logger, and the current log message.

Before an item is written to a transport, it must be formatted from an object into a string. This
can be done on a per transport basis using the
[`format`](/api/log/interface/TransportOptions#format) option, like so.

```ts
import { ConsoleTransport, formats } from '@boost/log';

const transport = new ConsoleTransport({
  format: (item) => `${item.level} ${item.message}`,
  // Or a pre-built format
  format: formats.json,
});
```

Boost provides formats by default, all of which are pre-configured into each built-in transport.
Feel free to use the [built-in formats](/api/log/namespace/formats), or customize your own!

## Metadata

Sometimes additional metadata may be required that is not found within the pre-defined log item
fields. Metadata can be defined on the logger using an object, which is then passed to all log
items.

```ts
const log = createLogger({
  name: 'boost',
  metadata: {
    locale: 'en',
    region: 'eu',
  },
});
```

It can also be defined per log by passing an object as the 1st argument. Metadata defined at this
level will override the logger metadata.

```ts
log({ locale: 'de' }, "What's going on?");
```

> Fields `name`, `host`, and `pid` are reserved names and cannot be used.

## Transport types

There are multiple types of transports that can be used within a logger, all of which support a
[`TransportOptions`](/api/log/interface/TransportOptions) object. Some transports support additional
options, so please refer to their types.

### ConsoleTransport

The [`ConsoleTransport`](/api/log/class/ConsoleTransport) logs messages to the native `console` and
its corresponding level. This is the default transport when no transports are defined.

```ts
import { ConsoleTransport } from '@boost/log';

const transport = new ConsoleTransport();
```

### StreamTransport

The [`StreamTransport`](/api/log/class/StreamTransport) logs messages to any writeable stream or an
object that defines a [`write()`](/api/log/interface/Writable) method. Additional
[`StreamTransportOptions`](/api/log/interface/StreamTransportOptions) options may be provided.

```ts
import { StreamTransport } from '@boost/log';

const transport = new StreamTransport({
  levels: ['error', 'warn'],
  stream: process.stderr,
});
```

### FileTransport

The [`FileTransport`](/api/log/class/FileTransport) appends and logs messages to a file at the
defined path. Will automatically rotate files when a max file size is met. Additional
[`FileTransportOptions`](/api/log/interface/FileTransportOptions) options may be provided.

```ts
import { FileTransport } from '@boost/log';

const transport = new FileTransport({
  levels: ['error'],
  path: '/var/log/error.log',
});
```

### RotatingFileTransport

The [`RotatingFileTransport`](/api/log/class/RotatingFileTransport) is like
[`FileTransport`](/api/log/class/FileTransport), but also rotates files based on timestamps and a
chosen periodic interval. Additional
[`RotatingFileTransportOptions`](/api/log/interface/RotatingFileTransportOptions) options may be
provided.

```ts
import { RotatingFileTransport } from '@boost/log';

const transport = new RotatingFileTransport({
  levels: ['error'],
  path: '/var/log/error.log',
  rotation: 'daily',
});
```
