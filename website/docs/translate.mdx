Package and application level translations made easy.

## Installation

</Tabs>

## Environment variables

- `LANGUAGE`, `LANG` - The locale to explicitly use for translation loading.

## Translators

Translating messages is based around the concept of a "translator", which is an implementation
around [i18next](https://www.npmjs.com/package/i18next) that provides file system based resources
bundles, in-memory caching, sane default configuration, automatic locale detection, plus all the
features found in i18next.

The translator is _designed for Node.js_, primarily for package level translations, command line
scripts, developer tools, and even applications, but _not_ for the web or the browser.

To begin, instantiate a translator with `createTranslator` with a list of [namespaces](#namespaces)
to load, a list of [resource paths](#resources) to locate bundles in, and an optional
[options](#options) object. This returns a function that can be used for loading and retrieving
translations.

```ts
import { createTranslator } from '@boost/translate';

const msg = createTranslator(['common', 'errors'], '../path/to/resources');
```

> The first namespace provided becomes the "default namespace".

The returned translator function, aptly named `msg` above, should be used anywhere that a message
string should be translated. It accepts [translation key(s)](#translations) as the 1st argument, an
optional object for interpolation as the 2nd argument, and an optional
[options object](#message-options) as the 3rd argument.

```ts
msg('common:welcome', { name: 'Boost' }); // Hello Boost!
```

> Once the translator has been created, associated [resource files](#resources) must also be
> created.

### Options

The following options can be passed to `createTranslator`. They _cannot_ be customized after
creation.

- `autoDetect` (`boolean`) - Automatically detect the locale from the environment. Defaults to
  `true`.
- `debug` (`boolean`) - Enable i18next debugging by logging info to the console. Defaults to
  `false`.
- `fallbackLocale` (`Locale | Locale[]`) - Fallback locale(s) to use when the detected locale isn't
  translated. Defaults to `en`.
- `locale` (`Locale`) - Locale to explicitly use.
- `lookupType` (`'all' | 'currentOnly' | 'languageOnly'`) - Order in which to load and lookup locale
  translations. Based on the i18next `load` option.
- `resourceFormat` (`'js' | 'json' | 'yaml'`) - File format resource bundles are written in.
  Defaults to `yaml`.

#### Message options

And these options can be passed to the created translator function (`msg` above).

- `defaultValue` (`string`) - Default value to return if a translation was not found.
- `count` (`number`) - Count used to determine plurals.
  [More information](https://www.i18next.com/translation-function/plurals).
- `context` (`string`) - Context used for special parsing (male, female, etc).
  [More information](https://www.i18next.com/translation-function/context).
- `interpolation` (`i18next.InterpolationOptions`) - Interpolation options to pass down to i18next.
  [More information](https://www.i18next.com/translation-function/interpolation#additional-options).
- `locale` (`Locale`) - Force translation to this locale.
- `postProcess` (`string | string[]`) - Post-processors to run on the translation.

### Locale detection

To load resource bundles, we require a locale. A locale is code based representation of a human
language and is based on [IETF language tags](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IETF_language_tag).
Boost locales align with ISO 639, with the language being lowercased (`en`), and the optional region
being uppercased and separated by a dash (`en-US`).

The locale is automatically detected from the environment using the following lookup strategies, one
by one, until a valid locale is found.

- Defined by the `locale` option or through the translator's `changeLocale` method.
- Passed on the command line with the `--locale` option.
- Defined a `LANGUAGE` or `LANG` environment variable.
- Inherited from the operating system.

## Resources

A resource bundle is a per locale collection of [namespaced](#namespaces)
[translation](#translations) files, located within a resource path passed to `createTranslator`.

An example file structure of a resources folder, with multiple locale bundles, would look something
like the following.

```
res/
├── en/
│   ├── common.yaml
│   ├── errors.yaml
│   └── validations.yaml
├── en-GB/
│   ├── common.yaml
│   └── validations.yaml
└── fr/
    └── ...
```

### Namespaces

A [namespace](https://www.i18next.com/principles/namespaces) is a file that contains
[translations](#translations), is located within a locale bundle, and can be written in JavaScript,
JSON, or YAML (default and preferred).

```js title="res/en/common.js"
module.exports = {
  welcome: 'Hello {{name}}!',
};
```

```json title="res/en/common.json"
{
  "welcome": "Hello {{name}}!"
}
```

```yaml title="res/en/common.yaml"
welcome: Hello {{name}}!
```

When retrieving messages with the translator function, the namespace can be targeted by prefixing
the key and separating with a colon.

```ts
msg('common:welcome'); // Hello {{name}}!
```

## Translations

A translation is a message string (also known as copy) identified by a unique key (per namespace).
They can be retrieved using the translator function (`msg` above).

> Translations inherit all functionality from i18next, so I suggest reading up on the

### Context

[Contextual messages](https://www.i18next.com/translation-function/context) allow for different
messages based on contextual data, through the combination of multiple keys and the `context`
option.

```yaml title="res/en/user.yaml"
partner: Significant other
partner_male: Husband
partner_female: Wife
```

```ts
msg('user:partner', {}, { context: 'male' }); // Husband
msg('user:partner', {}, { context: 'female' }); // Wife
```

### Plurals

[Pluralizing messages](https://www.i18next.com/translation-function/plurals) is easily solved
through the combination of multiple keys and the `count` option.

```yaml title="res/en/cart.yaml"
item: {{count}} item
item_plural: {{count}} items
```

```ts
msg('cart:item', {}, { count: 1 }); // 1 item
msg('cart:item', {}, { count: 10 }); // 10 items
```

### Nesting

There are 2 forms of nesting. The first is
[nested keys](https://www.i18next.com/translation-function/essentials#accessing-keys) within a
namespace file, and they can be accessed using dot notation.

```yaml title="res/en/prompts.yaml"
dialog:
  confirm: Are you sure?
  back: Go back!
```

```ts
msg('prompts:dialog.back'); // Go back!
```

The second form is [nested messages](https://www.i18next.com/translation-function/nesting) through a
special `$t()` syntax.

```yaml title="res/en/prompts.yaml"
confirm: Are you sure? $t(warning)
warning: This cannot be undone!
```

```ts
msg('prompts:confirm'); // Are you sure? This cannot be undone!
```
